# Vehicle-Identification-for-Traffic-Safety

This repository contains the code and resources for the Vehicle Identification for Traffic Safety project.

# Overview
This project focuses on developing an automated system designed to enhance road safety by accurately detecting and tracking vehicles, monitoring their speed, and identifying critical safety violations. It integrates computer vision with low-cost hardware to provide real-time alerts.

# Features
->Vehicle Detection: Identifies and classifies various types of vehicles, including cars, buses, trucks, motorbikes, and bicycles.
->Speed Monitoring: Estimates the speed of detected vehicles.
->Safety Violation Identification: Automatically flags violations such as over-speeding, helmet-less riding, and improper cycling posture.
->Real-time Alerts: Integrated with Arduino and an LCD display to provide immediate on-site warning messages and violation statuses.

# Technologies Used
Object Detection & Tracking: YOLOv8, DeepSORT
Programming Language: Python, C++ (for Arduino)
Libraries/Frameworks: OpenCV, NumPy
Hardware: Arduino Uno, Camera Module (laptop), LCD Display (20x4)
